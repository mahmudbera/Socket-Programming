# Socket Programming
This repository contains a basic socket programming project that demonstrates client-server communication in Java. The project aims to provide a simple example of how sockets can be used to enable communication between two applications over a network.

## Project Overview
The project consists of two main components:  
Client: Connects to the server, sends messages, and receives responses.  
Server: Listens for client connections, receives messages from clients, and sends responses back.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

-To demonstrate the basics of socket programming in Java.  
-To provide a simple example of how a client and server can communicate over a network.  
-To illustrate the process of setting up and managing socket connections.  

## Features
Establishes a connection between a client and a server using Java sockets.  
Facilitates simple message exchange between the client and server.
